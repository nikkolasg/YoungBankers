            <p>"ROTA envisages a world in which all young people have access to the education and training they need in order to realize their full potential and shape the development of their communities. ROTAâ€™s mission is that, together with partners, volunteers, and local communities, ROTA works to ensure that people affected by crisis across Asia and around the world have continuous access to relevant and high-quality primary and secondary education. ROTA operates in ten countries across Asia; in Qatar, ROTA engages young people and other community members in addressing educational and development challenges both at home and abroad.</p>


            <p>ROTAs pathway to achieving this vision and mission is through enhancing skills development, using sports as a tool for education, integrating environment education, and revitalizing the use of Arabic. In the coming years, ROTA will strive to deliver on its mission through becoming a pioneering and top ranked Qatari NGO with a significant donor and partnership base, directly supporting education programs in Asia."</p>
